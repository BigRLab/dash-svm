# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Explorer

This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

You can find the latest [dev version of the app here](https://dash-svm-dev.herokuapp.com/),
and the [official version here](https://dash-svm.herokuapp.com/).
